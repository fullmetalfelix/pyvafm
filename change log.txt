20/09/2013 15:50 - Added change log

23/09/2013 10:22 the commit "I think this diffe" was a typo I meant to say the file has no changes but I think some of the line spacings may have been altered so the actual code hasn't changes.

23/09/2013 12:15 Added and, not and or gates.

23/09/2013 13:50 Added Xor and Nor gates.

23/09/2013 15:48 Added Abs and power functions

25/09/2013 14:16 Added differentiation, integration, comparison and min/max circuits

26/09/2013 14.28 BugFix: added "pass" in delay.Update()

27/09/2013 02.00 Major changes to the main VAFM class:
	VAFM class renamed Machine and moved to vafmcircuits.py. vafmcore is now empty
	The Machine class now has input and output channels so it can be used as a composite circuit
	Subcircuits inside a Machine can receive/send signals from/to the Machine input/output channels 
	through the meta Input/Output channels.
	Connections are handled with the Connect function, which now supports unlimited arguments, the first being
	the channels from which the signal is taken, and all the following the channels to which send the signal.
	Within a machine only output-to-input connections are allowed. Global input channels of a machine can be
	connected to subcircuits input channels, and subcircuits outputs can be connected to global outputs.

28/09/2013 
	improved and added documentation
	output circuit:
		RegisterChannel renamed to Register
		added an Unregister function
		behaviour improved and extended

27/09/2013 14:48 Added all signal processing circuits and added the saw tooth wave.

04/10/2013 --.-- Added examples folder for input file samples
04/10/2013 --.-- corrected some doc comments, added images folder for pretty docs
04/10/2013 --.-- waver.sawtooth channel renamed to waver.saw

2/10/2013 13:42 added flip flops

3/10/2013 15:31 Added filter, PI, PID, limiter, ramper and averager

4/10/2013 11:44 Added Interpolation (the cantilever file was to test I could pass the object from the main file to another file)

16/10/2013 --:-- Average moved to vafmcircuits_avg.py
				'Average' circuit remaned 'avg'
				
				PI and PID moved to vafmcircuits_control.py - documentation corrected
				corrected bug in PI and PID codes
				
				In ActiveLowPass,  Gain->gain, Q and gain are not mandatory, default sallen key values will be used if none is given
				
				Limiter->limiter moved to vafmcircuits_control.py - doc and code corrected
				in channel renamed signal
				
				OpAbs -> opAbs
				OpPower ->opPow
				
				
17/10/2013 --:-- removed *test*.py from Doxygen documentation
				removed flipflop files: some circuits are not correct
				
18/10/2013 --:-- create vafmcircuits_output for output circuits
				create vafmcircuits_signal_gens for signal generators circuits
				added square circuit for square waves
				BUGFIX! waver circuit had the incorrect frequency!!!
				
23-10-2013 --:-- Updated Interpolation for arbitrary force fields, added cantilever and added Scanner
29-10-2013 --:-- Merged forks.
30-10-2013 --:-- added test files in /examples/
				removed the test_*.py exclusion from .gitignore
31-10-2013 --:-- limiter circuit moved in signal_processing
				added SetInput function to Machine
				fixed some documentation for Machine and Circuit
				added Dump() function to output circuit
11-11-2013 late! logic updated, circuits renamed!
